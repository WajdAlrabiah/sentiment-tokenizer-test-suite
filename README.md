# Sentiment Tokenizer Test Suite

This project demonstrates **text tokenization** and **sentiment analysis** using Hugging Face's Transformers library.  
It includes unit tests using **PyTest** to verify the correctness of the tokenization logic and sentiment inference results.

## Features
- **Tokenization:** Splits input text into tokens, separating words, numbers, and punctuation.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Uses the pretrained model `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest` to classify sentiment.  
- **Automated Testing:** Validates both tokenization and sentiment inference with `pytest`.
